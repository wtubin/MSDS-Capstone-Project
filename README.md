# Teacher Retention: Identifying Areas to Improve Teacher Recruitment and Retention in North Carolina Public Schools

### By Bin Yu, Nuoya Rezsonya, Jacob Drew

In this repository we will log what we have done on identifying areas to improve teach recuritment and retention in North Carolina public schools. In American, there are more than 100,000 classrooms across the country staffed by an instructor who is not fully qualified to teach due to the teacher retention issue faced by many educational administrators. 1. A lot of times, districts fail to keep qualified teachers and have to hire under qualified candidates to llthe vacancies. Teacher attrition is a major problem in America's public school
system. The high rate of the teacher attrition is hurting the school effectiveness, students' academic achievement, and district budgets. In North Carolina,teacher recruitment and retention have been listed as the No.5 of top 10 education issues for 2019 by Public School Forum. In this project, we will use we will use collect a sets of data like NC public school data,district IRS data, and district criminal data, then use machine learning algorithm to find the factors for the teacher attitions.
