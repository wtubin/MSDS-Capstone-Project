# MSDS-Capstone-Project
By Bin Yu, Nuoya Rezsonya

In this repo we log all of our work on the MSDS capsone project. 
Here is our planning:

In the traditional bail system, bail determination is based on four factors: seriousness of the crime, ties to the community, the flight risk posed by the defendant, and the danger posed by the defendant to his or her community. Judges must make decisions about whether to release defendants, and under what terms. A growing body of evidence indicates that the nation’s bail system keeps many low-risk defendants incarcerated before trial, while those who may pose a higher risk are released because they have the money to make bail. Beside the four major factors in bail determination, there are other potential factors that should have been taken into consideration when a bail decision needs to be made: 
  ** Age at the first offense
  •	Criminal history and previous failing to appear in court hearing
•	Employment history and current status
•	Financial status 
•	Marital status and household size 
•	Substance-abuse history 
•	Mental health history
Bail algorithms come into play and judges could utilize them to make more informed decisions. The likelihood of committing a crime again and risk of failing to appear in court hearing should be the two outcomes of this specific algorithm.
